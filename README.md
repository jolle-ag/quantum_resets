# Measurement-induced resetting in open quantum systems
Sample codes that can be used to reproduce the results from the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.04403 by Andreu Riera-Campeny, Jan Ollé and Axel Masó-Puigdellosas.

The most informative notebook is "open_qubit.ipynb". We have added a qiskit version of our simulations for unitary dynamics for illustrative purposes.
