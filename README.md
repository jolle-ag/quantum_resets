# Measurement-induced resetting in open quantum systems
Sample codes that can be used to reproduce the results from our paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.04403. 

The most informative notebook is "open_qubit.ipynb". We have added a qiskit version of our simulations for unitary dynamics for illustrative purposes.
